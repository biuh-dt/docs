# Teaching Methodologies for Digital Technologies Program

<br>

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the teaching methodologies adopted by the Digital Technologies Program, 
focusing on the "Learning by Doing" approach. The aim is to provide a comprehensive and integrated learning 
experience for students, ensuring they gain practical skills and knowledge through hands-on projects and self-study.

<br>

## 2. Learning by Doing
### 2.1 Core Philosophy
The "Learning by Doing" approach emphasizes hands-on learning and project-based education. Students are promised to complete at least one key project in every engineering course. This method not only enhances their technical skills but also develops their ability to work in teams and solve real-world problems.

### 2.2 Course Design
- **Difficulty Level**: The course difficulty is designed to cater to the majority of students, ensuring that high-level students are also supported through self-learning resources and mentorship.
- **German Style Workload Calculation**: The teacher’s workload is calculated based on "Actual Contact" time, which includes Lectures, Seminars, Supervised Self-Study, and Exercise.
- **Small-class Teaching**: Courses are taught in small classes to ensure quality communication between students and teachers.

### 2.3 Teaching Materials
All teaching materials are centrally stored in a unified online resource repository to ensure easy access for students.

## 3. Actual Contact
### 3.1 Teaching Hour Arrangement
The official HSBI module plan is adopted, with a focus on practical and interactive learning. The breakdown of teaching hours is as follows:
- **Practical (Lab) or Seminar (Classroom) Teaching**: 16 hours
- **Supervised Self-Study (SSS)**: 16 hours
- **Exercise (for Final Presentations or Revision Sessions)**: 8 hours

### 3.2 Supervised Self-Study (SSS)
- **Purpose**: To increase flexibility in communication between students and teachers.
- **Implementation**: Teachers can choose different ways to provide guidance during SSS. Students are allowed to leave if they have no questions, and teachers can use the time for project work, guided discussions, or answering questions.
- **Flexibility**: The format of SSS is not mandatory, and teachers have the flexibility to choose their own teaching style.

### 3.3 Timetable Demo
The ratio of lectures to practice is determined by the teacher. Below is a demo weekly schedule (unit: teaching hours):

| Week | Actual Contact (AC) | Lecture or Seminar (LS) | Practice or Lab (PL) | Exercise or Revision or Presentation (ERP) | Supervised Self-Study (SSS) |

## 4. Self-study

To support learners from various backgrounds, each course provides approximately 110 hours of self-learning materials, 
ranging from basic introductions to advanced practical content. Students can learn flexibly based on their personal needs. 
The final assessment focuses on comprehensive project performance, emphasizing competency and problem-solving rather than rote memorization of self-study materials.

## 5. Final Grade Calculation
### 5.1 Multi-dimensional Evaluation
- **General Performance (On-going Tasks)**
- **Final Presentation (Group Work)**
- **Final Presentation (Individual Q&A)**
- **Final Exam (Written Test)**

### 5.2 Key Points
- **Group Work**: This system supports the importance of group work, which is highly valued by international professors.
- **Fairness**: The inclusion of general performance, individual Q&A, and final exam results ensures fairness for students who perform well independently.
- **Ongoing Engagement**: General performance is assessed through attendance and task-based checkpoints.
- **Flexibility**: Instructors select evaluation dimensions based on the characteristics of each course, fully considering the uniqueness of each subject.
